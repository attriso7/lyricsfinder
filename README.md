A simple code for getting lyrics from genius API
In this small project i used the LyricsGenius python library which gets the meta data from Genius API and the sraps the lyrics with the help of BeautifulSoup library.

I Have used API key in this project and if you want to run the code go to https://genius.com/developers and create an API Client to get started.
